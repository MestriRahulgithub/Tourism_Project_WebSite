    <P style="background-color: chartreuse;"> Realising the promotion that movies provide to locales where they were shot, the tourism department has decided to market them in a way that allows visitors to relive the movie experience.
        KOCHI:   Remember the haunting song ‘Uyire’ from the iconic movie Bombay? It captured the pain of Shekhar Narayanan Pillai, played by Arvind Swami, yearning for his lady love Shaila Bano, portrayed by Manisha Koirala.
        
        Apart from the lyrics, the music and the chemistry of the actors, the scenic background also played a big part in making the song a hit. The waves breaking on the black rocks, the rain-washed stones of the fort and the lush greenery combined to leave audiences mesmerised.</P>
